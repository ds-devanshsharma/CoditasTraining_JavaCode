 * 3). Create a class Medicine to represent a drug manufactured by a pharmaceutical
 * company. Provide a function displayLabel() in this class to print Name and address of
 * the company.
 * Derive Tablet, Syrup and Ointment classes from the Medicine class.
 * Override the displayLabel() function in each of these classes to print additional
 * information suitable to the type of medicine.
 * For example, in case of tablets, it could be "store in a cool dry place", in case of
 * ointments it could be "for external use only" etc. Create a class TestMedicine. Write
 * main function to do the following: Declare an array of Medicine references of size 10
 * Create a medicine object of the type as decided by a randomly generated integer in the
 * range 1 to 3. Refer Java API Documentation to find out random generation features.
 * Check the polymorphic behavior of the displayLabel() method.
