 * 2)Create an abstract class Instrument which has the abstract function play.

 * Override the play method inside all three classes printing a message. "Piano is playing
   tan tan tan tan " for Piano class "Flute is playing toot toot toot toot" for Flute class
 * "Guitar is playing tin tin tin" for Guitar class
 * You must not allow the user to declare an object of Instrument class. Create an array of|
 * 10 Instruments. Assign different types of instrument to Instrument reference. Check for
 * the polymorphic behavior of the play method. Use the instanceof operator to print
